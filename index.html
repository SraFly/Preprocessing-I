    <p class= "introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>My name is Pebbles in River. I am a Tabaxi fighter. I have a long history of adventuring all across Faerun. I started out in my home village in an orphanage along with my brothers and sisters. We were all adopted by a rouge Drow named Jarlaxle. From there we were all brought to different places where our individual skills would grow best. I was brought to the Dwarf city of Mithral Hall where the good King Bruenor Battlehammer took me in as one of his own kind and allowed me to train with the Legend Drizzt Do'Urden. When the Dwarves marched to take back Gauntlgrym, I went with them. I fought along side my new family, and saw the price the Dwarves paid in blood to take back their home. King Bruenor Battlehammer congratulated me on my valor, and welcomes me back whenever I return. I now adventure to find my brothers and sisters, as well as my parents. I received word from Jarlaxle that there's a possibility they could be somewhere in the Underdark. I must find them.</p>
